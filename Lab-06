1.	Configure worker-b in such a way that no new pods will be scheduled on it, but existing pod will not moved away
2.	Mark worker-b with node label disk=ssd. Start a new nginx pod that uses nodeAffinity to be schedule on nodes that have the label disk=ssd set. Start the pod and see what happens
3.	Remove all restriction from worker-b
